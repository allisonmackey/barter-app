## Specs 
* As an user I want to be able to create an account and select what kind of services I can provide for bartering
* As a user I want to be able to see my 'feed' after logging in which will display services/goods being offered by other people for trade.
* I want to be able to update the services I can provide 
* I want to be able to comment on services/goods others are offering 
* I want to be able to message other users regarding the services/goods they're offering
* I want to be able to set a time for us to trade goods/services

Future Goals: 
- Allow user to sign up with first & last name
- Allow user to have 'profile' with information about the user
- Implement 'by zipcode' drop down menu so that users can see posts from other users within a certain radius --> https://www.zipcodeapi.com/API
- Implement 'friends' capability so that user can add other users and see their 'activity'
- Implement Messaging capability
